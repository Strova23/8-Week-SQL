You may follow along with the questions and find all the information for this case study [**here**](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)

## ‚ùì Problem Statement ‚ùì
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about the visiting patterns of his customers: how much money they‚Äôve spent, and which menu items are their favorite. 

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

**Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:**
