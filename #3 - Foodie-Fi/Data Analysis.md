```sql
with next_plan as 
(
select
  *,
  lead(plan_id, 1) over (partition by customer_id order by plan_id) as next_plan
from subscriptions
) 

select
  count(next_plan) as churn_count,
  round(count(*) * 100 / (select count(distinct customer_id) from subscriptions), 1) as percentage
from next_plan
where plan_id = 0 and next_plan = 4;
